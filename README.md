Time series analysis of Brick and Mortar sales data

In this repository I explore times series forecasting methods and models for forecasting product demand.
Anticipating demand for products is a key requirement of any successful supply chain. Having an accurate estimate of demand can help an organization plan and control its supply chain to keep the customers happy with a certain degree of reliability of performance. Unanticipated changes in demand can cause stress on the supply chain eventually leading to customer dissatisfaction and eventually churn.

We will explore two different ways to forecast:

- Time series analysis of the sales data: Studying the data with respect to itself over time
..* ETS Models
..* ARIMA Models

Supervised learning - Use date time as features along with features derived from historical values of the data.
..* Linear Regression Model
..* LightGBM Model

he data used is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/demand-forecasting-kernels-only/data which provides the sales data for brick and mortar stores.
